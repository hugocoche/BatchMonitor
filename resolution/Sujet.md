# Topic 01: To the Market

The country of HEALTHYLAND wishes to increase its potential for healthy eating, it wants to acquire at least:

- 100,000 apples,
- 200,000 oranges,
- 100 watermelons,
- 400 bunches of bananas and as many pineapples.

To do this, they turn to a fruit merchant named FRUITVENDOR. This merchant collects the produce, used or not, from all the fields and farms.

These merchants offer 3 types of Batch_list (M$ = million dollars).

|                | Batch 1 | Batch 2 | Batch 3 |
| -------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Apples         | 500     | 300     | 800     |
| Oranges        | 1000    | 2000    | 1500    |
| Watermelons    | 10      | 20      | 15      |
| Bananas        | 100     | 80      | 15      |
| Pineapples     | 80      | 120     | 200     |
| Costs of Batches | 10M$ | 12M$   | 15M$    |

1 - Write the problem as a linear program and solve it. We will assume, perhaps wrongly, that the batches are fractionable. We can propose a graphical representation of the constraints.

2 - On his side, a unitary fruit manufacturer FRESHFRUIT wants to take over the market. He is therefore looking to determine the unit prices of the 5 types of fruit. The goal is for each of the 3 batches to cost at most like FRUITVENDOR's batches. But he is also looking to maximize his profit. Write the associated linear problem and solve it. We will compare the matrix forms of the two problems. We will also compare their respective solutions. This linear problem is called the dual form of the previous linear problem.

3 - FRUITVENDOR varies the price of his first batch. Study the impact of this variation for the two problems.
